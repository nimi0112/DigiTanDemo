# DigiTan Demo
A sample project to test look and feel of some design iterations for Grappus Internal use.

Through this project we have understood:
1. The concept of binding model and how it helps keeping our code clean.
2. The use of kotlin Higher Order Functions for getting callbacks in Recyclerview.
